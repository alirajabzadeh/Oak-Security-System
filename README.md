# 🌳 Oak Security System
Oak Security System , The Endpoint Cyber Security Solution .

This project is an advanced endpoint protection system designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate modern malware behaviors such as ransomware attacks, unauthorized screenshots, cookie theft, and credential exfiltration and etc.

Rather than relying solely on signature-based detection, this project focuses on behavioral analysis and real-time protection, aiming to stop malicious actions before damage occurs.


## Windows Kernel–Level Endpoint Protection

This project leverages Windows kernel-mode programming to provide low-level endpoint security, enabling deep visibility and control over system behavior that is not possible from user-mode alone.

By operating at the kernel level, the system can monitor, intercept, and block malicious actions at their source, before they reach user applications or cause damage.
